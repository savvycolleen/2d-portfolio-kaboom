  pc: `This is my computer! I've done tons of learning and teaching from here. I am currently a full-stack developer, and I love building new projects. You should check out my <a href="https://savannah-portfolio.netlify.app/" target="_blank">portfolio</a>!`,
  "cs-degree": `Oh, look! My degrees! I have my bachelor's in elementary education, and my master's in literacy. While seemingly irrelevant for coding, many of my passions began here. Also, niche obssessions like brain states and metacognition, but I digress. Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19RCg0LBKIoSMufgiN86zl8ZvHyJ4pzU-M0DmyP_ZXDg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">lecture on MVC</a> to prove that I can tie my worlds together. It may or may not be Harry Potter style.`,
  "sofa-table": `That's my coffee table. You'll likely find empty coffee cups and crochet projects galore here. I am constantly either starting a new project, or finding my next project to start. Oh, can you relate? Let's be <a href="https://www.instagram.com/savvydoesyarn/" target="_blank">friends</a>!`,
  tv: `That's my TV. I won't lie. I love binging a good series. From Friends, to Downtown Abbey, to the Sopranos, I love it all. My most recent watches are Sh≈çgun, The 3 Body Problem, and Below Deck: Mediterranean. Variety is important, right? üòÖ Tell me what you are watching! I'm not kidding. I want to know.`,
  bed: `Before bed is often my brain's favorite time to obssessively plot what projects I should start next or deep dive into a new obssession. Anyone else?`,
  resume: `This is my desk, and on it is my resume. I won't be posting it here, but it's pretty cool, and you should definitely ask to see it. Here's my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/savannah-acevedo-4ba960123/" target="_blank">linkedin</a>!`,
  projects: `Info about this project : I would have never dreamt I could make something like this. Hats off to JSLegendDev. Watch his tutorials <a href="https://youtube.com/@jslegenddev" target="_blank">here</a>! I'm also very thankful for my <a href="https://100devs.org/" target="_">100devs</a> and <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/" target="_">VirtualCoffee</a> communities.`,
  library: `I have been an avid read since I was a child, but I am not an obssessive book-buyer (thank you, public libraries!).
  Thanks to my English minor, I do have some British Literature on my shelves, and lots of kids books for my toddler. In recent years, I have been really into fantasy! Have we read any of the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91040164-savannah-colleen" target="_blank">same books</a>? Let's dish!`,
